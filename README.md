If you are not familliar with how SecretStore works, you can read more details at [Open Ethereum's documentation](https://openethereum.github.io/Secret-Store)

From [documentation](https://openethereum.github.io/Secret-Store):

The Secret Store is a core technology that enables:

- distributed elliptic curve (EC) key pair generation - key is generated by several parties using special cryptographic protocol, so that:
	- private key portion remains unknown to every single party;
	- public key portion could be computed on every party and could be safely exposed to external entities;
	- every party hold the ‘share’ of the private key;
	- any subset of `t+1` parties could unite to restore the private portion of the key;
	- any subset of less than `t+1` parties could not restore the private portion of the key;
- distributed key storage - private key shares are stored separately by every party and are never exposed neither to another parties, nor to external entities;
- threshold retrieval according to blockchain permissions - all operations that are requiring private key, require at least `t+1` parties to agree on ‘Permissioning contract’ state.
